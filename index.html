                <h3> Bio </h3>
                <p> I'm a third-year student studying Computer Science and Statistics at UC Berkeley. I'm always excited about the new 
                    technologies coming out and want to become part of them. Building things and solving problems sound really fun to 
                    me, so I want to pursue a career in software engineering or data science. When I'm not working on my technical skills, 
                    I enjoy cooking and playing the piano. I also like playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, and I'm always down for a duel!
